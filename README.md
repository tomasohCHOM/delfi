# Python Masterclass

Teaching my sister how to program. We will be covering Python, Java, and some 
HTML + CSS. We will go over programming concepts such as data types, input / 
output, conditions, loops, essential data structures and some other programming 
practices. This is in preparation for her AP Computer Science class, but we will 
do some cool projects together as well.
